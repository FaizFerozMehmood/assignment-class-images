    <p>Birds have different sizes and can be as small as 2 inches and as big as 2.75 metres. For instance, bee
        hummingbird (smallest) and ostrich (largest). Birdâ€™s existence dates back to 160 million years ago.
        There are different types of birds that exist which vary in characteristics. For instance, there are penguins

        and symbolize rain and good weather. Next, there are bats and vultures as well. Birds connect very closely to
        the environment and are quite intuitive.

        They can predict the weather conditions and some are kept near coal mines for the prediction of a mine
        explosion. It is because they are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide. They are quite
        social and enjoy singing as well. Birds enjoy the freedom of moving anywhere without boundaries.
